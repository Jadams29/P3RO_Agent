## The P³RO Architecture: A Framework for Iterative Prompt Refinement

The **P³RO (Plan, Probe, Polish, Reflect, and Orient)** architecture. P³RO is not a replacement for PDCA, OODA, or ReAct, but a sophisticated synthesis that orchestrates their strengths into a cohesive and powerful system. It provides a structured yet adaptive methodology for transforming a nascent user prompt into a highly effective, goal-aligned artifact.

### 2.1 Naming and Core Concept

The name P³RO encapsulates the key phases of the agent's workflow, directly mapping to the synthesized concepts from the foundational frameworks:

  * **Plan:** This corresponds to the strategic `Plan` phase of the PDCA cycle. It is the initial setup phase where the agent establishes a clear understanding of the user's goal and formulates a high-level strategy for improvement.
  * **Probe & Polish:** These phases represent the core tactical work of the agent. The `Probe` phase is a rapid, iterative loop, analogous to the OODA `Observe-Decide-Act` cycle, where the agent generates and tests new prompt variations. The `Polish` phase is the final step where the best-performing prompt is prepared for delivery.
  * **Reflect & Orient:** This is the cognitive core of the agent, combining the critical `Orient` phase of the OODA loop with the evaluative `Check/Act` phases of PDCA. It is where the agent makes sense of feedback, learns from its attempts, and makes intelligent decisions about its next move.

Visually, the P³RO architecture can be conceptualized as a series of nested loops. The outermost loop is the strategic PDCA cycle that governs the entire task from start to finish. Within this, a more rapid OODA loop executes the tactical probing of different prompt improvements. At the very core, every individual action or tool use is powered by a ReAct-style `Thought -> Act -> Observation` micro-cycle, ensuring all operations are transparent and grounded.

### 2.2 The P³RO Cycle: A Step-by-Step Walkthrough

The agent's operation follows a logical progression through the P³RO phases, moving from high-level strategy to tactical execution and reflective adaptation.

#### Phase 1: PLAN (Strategic Initialization)

  * **Trigger:** The process begins when the user provides an initial prompt and a high-level, often abstract, goal (e.g., "Make this prompt more creative for generating social media posts").
  * **Action:** The agent's first responsibility is to translate this ambiguity into a concrete plan.
    1.  It invokes the `GoalDecomposer` tool. This tool uses an LLM to break down the user's abstract goal into a list of specific, measurable, and actionable criteria (e.g., "1. Adopt a witty and informal tone. 2. Include a question to drive engagement. 3. Mention the product's key benefit."). This step is fundamental for objective evaluation later on.
    2.  Next, it uses the `StrategyFormulator` tool. Taking the initial prompt and the newly decomposed criteria as input, this tool creates a high-level, ordered plan for improvement (e.g., "First, I will focus on establishing the persona. Second, I will integrate the engagement question. Finally, I will refine the language for tone.").
  * **Framework Correspondence:** This entire phase represents the `Plan` stage of the PDCA cycle. It establishes the objectives and the roadmap for achieving them.

#### Phase 2: PROBE (Tactical Iteration)

  * **Trigger:** A high-level plan and a set of evaluation criteria are in place.
  * **Action:** The agent now enters a rapid, OODA-like loop to test its strategy. This loop is the workhorse of the refinement process.
    1.  **Decide/Act:** The agent uses the `PromptGenerator` tool. Guided by the high-level plan and any learnings from previous iterations, it generates a new, modified version of the prompt.
    2.  **Observe:** The agent immediately tests this new prompt using the `PromptEvaluator` tool. This tool assesses the new prompt against the decomposed criteria defined in the `PLAN` phase, generating both quantitative scores (e.g., 7/10 for "witty tone") and qualitative feedback.
  * **Framework Correspondence:** This loop is a direct implementation of the `Observe-Decide-Act` components of the OODA loop, focused on rapid, tactical execution.

#### Phase 3: REFLECT & ORIENT (Sense-Making and Adaptation)

  * **Trigger:** An evaluation of a new prompt has been completed.
  * **Action:** This phase is the agent's cognitive engine, where raw data from the evaluation is transformed into intelligence.
    1.  **Orient:** The agent uses the `ReflectionSynthesizer` tool. This tool analyzes the scores and qualitative feedback from the `PromptEvaluator`. Its sole purpose is to answer the questions: "What worked? What failed? Why? What is our new understanding of the problem?" It synthesizes this analysis into a concise, actionable reflection (e.g., "Adding the question improved engagement but made the tone too formal; the next attempt must rephrase it more conversationally."). This is the direct implementation of OODA's critical `Orient` phase.
    2.  **Decide:** With a new orientation, the agent must decide on its next major step. It uses the `NextStepDecider` tool, which acts as a router. Based on the reflection and the history of progress, it chooses one of three paths, preventing the agent from getting stuck in unproductive loops [21]:
          * **Continue Probing:** If the evaluation shows progress or a clear path forward, the agent loops back to the `PROBE` phase, using the new reflection to guide the next `PromptGenerator` call.
          * **Revise Strategy:** If progress has stalled (e.g., scores have plateaued or decreased for multiple iterations), the current strategy is deemed ineffective. The agent breaks out of the `PROBE` loop and returns to the `PLAN` phase, using the `StrategyFormulator` again with all the accumulated knowledge to create a new, more informed high-level plan.
          * **Finish:** If the evaluation scores have met a predefined success threshold or a maximum number of iterations has been reached, the agent decides the task is complete.
  * **Framework Correspondence:** This phase combines the OODA `Orient` phase (in the `ReflectionSynthesizer`) with the PDCA `Check` and `Act` phases (in the `NextStepDecider`). It evaluates performance (`Check`) and determines the next course of action (`Act`), which could be to continue the cycle, revise the plan, or finalize the process.

#### Phase 4: POLISH (Finalization)

  * **Trigger:** The `NextStepDecider` tool has chosen the "Finish" path.
  * **Action:** The agent prepares its final output. It selects the highest-scoring prompt from its history and presents it to the user. Critically, it also provides a summary of the improvement journey, explaining how the final prompt meets the decomposed criteria derived from the user's original goal. This provides transparency and demonstrates the value created by the agent.

### 2.3 How P³RO Synergizes the Frameworks

The P³RO architecture is explicitly designed to create a system where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It achieves this by assigning each foundational framework to the level of abstraction where it is most effective.

  * **PDCA's Contribution:** The `Plan` and `Polish` phases, along with the high-level decision to `Revise Strategy`, embody the principles of PDCA. This provides the agent with crucial goal-orientation, structured progress, and a mechanism for continuous, long-term improvement. It acts as the strategic conscience, ensuring that the rapid tactical actions always serve the overarching mission.
  * **OODA's Contribution:** The `Probe` and `Reflect & Orient` phases form a potent OODA loop. This gives the agent tactical agility, allowing it to adapt its approach in real-time based on feedback. The explicit `Reflect & Orient` phase is a direct implementation of OODA's most powerful concept, moving the agent beyond simple trial-and-error to genuine learning and sense-making. This prevents the agent from getting stuck on a flawed plan, a common failure mode for more rigid systems.
  * **ReAct's Contribution:** ReAct is not a phase but the operational fabric of the entire system. Every tool call—from `GoalDecomposer` to `PromptEvaluator`—is executed as a ReAct-style micro-cycle. This means every action is preceded by a transparent thought process and followed by an observation. This provides profound benefits: it makes the agent's behavior auditable and debuggable, drastically reduces the likelihood of hallucinated or nonsensical actions, and allows for fine-grained error handling within each step.[17, 23]

By orchestrating these three frameworks in a hierarchical structure, P³RO creates an agent that is simultaneously strategic, tactical, adaptive, and transparent, making it exceptionally well-suited for the complex and creative task of prompt engineering.

## Part 3: An Extensive Implementation Blueprint for the P³RO Agent

This section provides the complete, code-agnostic schematics for constructing the P³RO agent. It details the agent's memory structure (state), its full suite of capabilities (tools), the precise LLM prompts that power them, and the control flow that governs their execution. This blueprint serves as the direct architectural specification for the Python implementation.

### 3.1 Agent State Definition

The agent's state is the central data structure that persists and is passed between each node in the execution graph. It serves as the agent's working memory, tracking all information relevant to the task.

  * **`initial_prompt`**: `str` - The original prompt provided by the user.
  * **`goal`**: `str` - The high-level improvement goal provided by the user.
  * **`decomposed_criteria`**: `List[str]` - The list of specific, measurable criteria derived from the goal.
  * **`high_level_plan`**: `str` - The current multi-step strategy for improving the prompt. This can be revised during the process.
  * **`prompt_history`**: `List` - A log of all attempted prompts. Each entry in the list is a dictionary containing:
      * `prompt_text`: The full text of the generated prompt.
      * `reasoning`: The rationale behind generating that specific prompt version.
      * `evaluation`: The full `EvaluationResult` object for that prompt.
  * **`current_reflection`**: `str` - The actionable insight synthesized from the most recent evaluation. This guides the next `Probe` iteration.
  * **`final_prompt`**: `str` - The best-performing prompt, populated only when the agent finishes.
  * **`iteration_count`**: `int` - A counter for the number of `Probe` cycles completed.

### 3.2 The P³RO Agent's Toolkit

The agent's capabilities are encapsulated in a set of specialized tools. Each tool is designed to perform a single, well-defined sub-task, typically powered by a targeted LLM call. The structured input/output of these tools, enforced by Pydantic schemas, ensures reliable and predictable data flow throughout the agent's lifecycle.

**Table 2: The P³RO Agent's Toolkit**

| Tool Name | Description | Input(s) from State | Pydantic Output Schema |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GoalDecomposer` | Translates the user's abstract goal into concrete, measurable criteria. | `goal` | `DecomposedGoal(criteria: List[str])` |
| `StrategyFormulator` | Creates a high-level, multi-step improvement plan based on the criteria. | `initial_prompt`, `decomposed_criteria`, `prompt_history` | `ImprovementPlan(plan: str)` |
| `PromptGenerator` | Generates a new, improved version of the prompt based on the current plan and reflections. | `high_level_plan`, `prompt_history`, `current_reflection` | `GeneratedPrompt(prompt_text: str, reasoning: str)` |
| `PromptEvaluator` | Critically evaluates a new prompt against the established criteria, providing scores and feedback. | `prompt_text` (from `PromptGenerator`), `decomposed_criteria` | `EvaluationResult(scores: List, qualitative_feedback: str)` |
| `ReflectionSynthesizer` | Analyzes an evaluation to produce a concise, actionable insight for the next iteration. | `evaluation` (from `PromptEvaluator`) | `Reflection(summary: str)` |
| `NextStepDecider` | The routing function that determines the agent's next major action (Continue, Revise, or Finish). | `prompt_history`, `iteration_count` | `NextAction(action: Literal)` |

#### 3.2.1 Tool: `GoalDecomposer`

  * **Purpose:** To translate a high-level user goal into a set of specific, actionable, and measurable criteria. This step is crucial for transforming a subjective task into an objective one.

  * **Input(s):** `goal` (string).

  * **Pydantic Output Schema:** `class DecomposedGoal(BaseModel): criteria: List[str]`

  * **Extensive LLM Prompt:**
    ```
    **Role:** You are a meticulous requirements analyst and prompt engineering expert. Your task is to decompose a user's high-level, often vague, goal for a prompt into a set of specific, orthogonal, and actionable criteria. These criteria will be used to objectively evaluate future versions of the prompt.

    **Context:**

      - The user wants to improve an initial prompt.
      - The user has provided the following goal: "{goal}"

    **Task:**

    1.  **Analyze the Goal:** Deeply analyze the user's goal. Identify the core intent and the key qualities the user is seeking in the final prompt's output. Consider aspects like tone, structure, persona, constraints, and desired output format.
    2.  **Decompose into Criteria:** Break down the goal into 3-5 distinct, measurable criteria. Each criterion should be a concise statement describing a specific quality or characteristic.
    3.  **Ensure Actionability:** Each criterion must be something that can be reasonably judged or measured when comparing two prompts. Avoid vague terms like "make it better." Instead, use precise language like "Increase the use of sensory details," "Adopt a more formal and academic tone," or "Ensure the output is structured as a JSON object with 'name' and 'description' keys."

    **Example:**

      - **User Goal:** "I want a prompt for a marketing copywriter that is more creative and engaging."
      - **Your Decomposed Criteria Output (as JSON):**
        {
        "criteria": [
        "Evoke a sense of urgency in the target audience.",
        "Incorporate at least two power words related to exclusivity.",
        "Use a conversational and slightly humorous tone.",
        "End with a clear and compelling call-to-action."
        ]
        }

    **Instructions:**

      - Generate ONLY the list of criteria.
      - Your output must be a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the following Pydantic schema:
        `class DecomposedGoal(BaseModel): criteria: List[str]`

    **User Goal to Decompose:**
    "{goal}"
    ```

#### 3.2.2 Tool: `StrategyFormulator`

  * **Purpose:** To create an initial high-level, multi-step plan for how to approach the prompt improvement task. This provides a strategic roadmap for the agent.
  * **Input(s):** `initial_prompt` (string), `decomposed_criteria` (List[str]), `prompt_history` (List[dict] - for revisions).
  * **Pydantic Output Schema:** `class ImprovementPlan(BaseModel): plan: str`
  * **Extensive LLM Prompt:**
    ```
    **Role:** You are an expert AI strategist and master prompt engineer. Your task is to devise a high-level, ordered plan to improve a given prompt based on a set of specific criteria. If this is a revision, you must learn from past failures.

    **Context:**
    - Initial Prompt: "{initial_prompt}"
    - Improvement Criteria: {decomposed_criteria}
    - History of Past Attempts (if any): "{prompt_history}"

    **Task:**
    1.  **Analyze the Gap:** Compare the Initial Prompt with the Improvement Criteria. Identify the biggest gaps and areas for improvement. If a history of past attempts exists, analyze why the previous strategy failed. The last entry in the history contains the most relevant feedback.
    2.  **Formulate a Strategy:** Create a logical, step-by-step plan to address these gaps. The plan should be a sequence of general approaches. Think about the order of operations. It might be best to fix the structure first, then the tone, then the specific details. If revising a failed strategy, explicitly state a *new* approach.
    3.  **Output the Plan:** Write the plan as a concise, multi-line string, formatted as a numbered list.

    **Example (First Pass):**
    - **Initial Prompt:** "Write about our new shoes."
    - **Improvement Criteria:**
    - **Your Formulated Plan Output (as JSON):**
      {
        "plan": "1. First, I will rewrite the prompt to explicitly establish the persona of a professional athlete.\\n2. Second, I will add specific instructions to focus on the 'ultralight foam' technology and its benefits.\\n3. Finally, I will adjust the language to be more energetic and use slang appropriate for a young, active audience."
      }

    **Instructions:**
    - Generate ONLY the plan string.
    - Your output must be a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the following Pydantic schema:
      `class ImprovementPlan(BaseModel): plan: str`

    **Your Task:**
    - Initial Prompt: "{initial_prompt}"
    - Improvement Criteria: {decomposed_criteria}
    - History of Past Attempts: "{prompt_history}"
    ```

#### 3.2.3 Tool: `PromptGenerator`

  * **Purpose:** To generate a new, improved version of the prompt based on the current strategy and history. This is the core generative step in the `Probe` cycle.
  * **Input(s):** `high_level_plan` (str), `prompt_history` (List[dict]), `current_reflection` (str).
  * **Pydantic Output Schema:** `class GeneratedPrompt(BaseModel): prompt_text: str; reasoning: str`
  * **Extensive LLM Prompt:**
    ```
    **Role:** You are a creative and meticulous prompt engineer executing one step of a larger plan. Your task is to generate a single, new version of a prompt that attempts to improve upon the previous version, guided by a high-level plan and specific reflections from the last attempt.

    **Context:**
    - The overall strategic plan is: "{high_level_plan}"
    - The history of previous attempts and their evaluations is: "{prompt_history}"
    - The key takeaway from the last evaluation (your primary focus for this iteration) is: "{current_reflection}"

    **Task:**
    1.  **Synthesize Context:** Review the entire context. Understand the main goal, what has been tried, and what the most recent analysis concluded. The most recent prompt to improve upon is the last one in the `prompt_history`. If the history is empty, improve the `initial_prompt`.
    2.  **Formulate a Thought (Reasoning):** Based on the `current_reflection`, decide on the *single most impactful change* you can make to the most recent prompt. This could be rephrasing a sentence, adding a constraint, changing the persona, or adding an example. State this thought process clearly and concisely. This will be your `reasoning`.
    3.  **Generate the New Prompt:** Write the complete text of the new, improved prompt. Do not just write the changed part; provide the full prompt from beginning to end.

    **Instructions:**
    - Your output must be a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the following Pydantic schema:
      `class GeneratedPrompt(BaseModel): prompt_text: str; reasoning: str`
    - The `reasoning` field should contain your thought process for this specific iteration.
    - The `prompt_text` field should contain the full text of the newly generated prompt.

    **Perform your task now based on the provided context.**
    ```

#### 3.2.4 Tool: `PromptEvaluator`

  * **Purpose:** To critically evaluate the newly generated prompt against the original criteria, providing objective scores and qualitative feedback.
  * **Input(s):** `new_prompt_text` (str), `decomposed_criteria` (List[str]).
  * **Pydantic Output Schema:** `class CriterionScore(BaseModel): criterion: str; score: int; justification: str` and `class EvaluationResult(BaseModel): scores: List; qualitative_feedback: str`
  * **Extensive LLM Prompt:**
    ```
    **Role:** You are a hyper-critical and objective AI prompt evaluator. Your task is to score a new prompt against a set of predefined criteria and provide a detailed justification for your scores. You must be impartial, rigorous, and analytical.

    **Context:**
    - The new prompt to be evaluated is: "{new_prompt_text}"
    - The evaluation criteria are: {decomposed_criteria}

    **Task:**
    1.  **Evaluate Against Each Criterion:** For each individual criterion in the list, perform the following:
        a.  Carefully assess how well the `new_prompt_text` satisfies that specific criterion.
        b.  Assign a score from 1 (fails completely) to 10 (perfectly satisfies). A score of 5 means it partially addresses the criterion but has significant room for improvement.
        c.  Write a brief, one-sentence justification for your score, citing specific evidence from the prompt text or noting its absence.
    2.  **Provide Holistic Feedback:** After scoring all criteria, write a short paragraph of overall qualitative feedback. Summarize the prompt's main strengths and weaknesses. Point out any unintended side effects of the changes and suggest the most important area for the next improvement.

    **Instructions:**
    - Your output must be a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the following Pydantic schema:
      `class CriterionScore(BaseModel): criterion: str; score: int; justification: str`
      `class EvaluationResult(BaseModel): scores: List; qualitative_feedback: str`
    - Be strict and consistent in your scoring. Do not give high scores easily. Your justification is more important than the score itself.

    **Perform your evaluation now.**
    ```

#### 3.2.5 Tool: `ReflectionSynthesizer`

  * **Purpose:** To analyze the evaluation results and produce a concise, actionable insight. This is the core of the `Reflect & Orient` phase, turning data into wisdom.
  * **Input(s):** `evaluation_result` (EvaluationResult object).
  * **Pydantic Output Schema:** `class Reflection(BaseModel): summary: str`
  * **Extensive LLM Prompt:**
    ```
    **Role:** You are a master strategist and learning algorithm. Your task is to analyze an evaluation report and synthesize a single, powerful insight that will guide the next action. You are performing the "Orient" step of the OODA loop.

    **Context:**
    - The most recent prompt was just evaluated. The results are: "{evaluation_result}"

    **Task:**
    1.  **Analyze the Data:** Look at the scores (especially the lowest ones) and the qualitative feedback.
    2.  **Identify the Core Pattern:** What is the most important story the data is telling? Did one change improve some criteria but hurt others? Was the main change ineffective? What is the root cause of the lowest scores?
    3.  **Synthesize a Reflection:** Distill your analysis into a single, concise, and actionable sentence. This reflection should state what was learned and clearly imply what should be done differently in the next iteration. It must be a directive for the `PromptGenerator`.

    **Example:**
    - **Evaluation Result:** Scores for 'clarity' went up to 8, but scores for 'creativity' went down to 3. Feedback mentions the prompt is now "too rigid and formulaic."
    - **Your Synthesized Reflection (as JSON):**
      {
        "summary": "The attempt to add structure made the prompt too restrictive, stifling creativity; the next iteration must introduce more flexibility, perhaps by adding an 'out-of-the-box ideas' section, while maintaining the new-found clarity."
      }

    **Instructions:**
    - Generate ONLY the summary string.
    - Your output must be a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the following Pydantic schema:
      `class Reflection(BaseModel): summary: str`

    **Perform your synthesis now.**
    ```

#### 3.2.6 Tool: `NextStepDecider` (The Router)

  * **Purpose:** To decide the next state of the agent based on evaluation results and history. This is a critical control flow mechanism. While this can be implemented in pure Python for robustness, defining it as an LLM call illustrates the reasoning process. For the final implementation, Python logic is preferred.
  * **Input(s):** `prompt_history` (List[dict]), `iteration_count` (int).
  * **Pydantic Output Schema:** `class NextAction(BaseModel): action: Literal`
  * **Decision Logic (to be implemented in Python):**
    1.  Calculate the average score of the most recent evaluation from `prompt_history`.
    2.  **Finish Condition:** If the average score is >= 8.5 OR if `iteration_count` >= 5, return `FINISH`.
    3.  **Revise Strategy Condition:** If `iteration_count` >= 2, compare the average score of the last evaluation with the one before it. If the score has not increased, return `REVISE_STRATEGY`.
    4.  **Default Condition:** Otherwise, return `CONTINUE_PROBING`.

### 3.3 Agent Control Flow

The agent's logic is structured as a stateful graph, where nodes represent the tools and edges represent the flow of control.

  * **Nodes:** `GoalDecomposer`, `StrategyFormulator`, `PromptGenerator`, `PromptEvaluator`, `ReflectionSynthesizer`, `NextStepDecider`.
  * **Entry Point:** `GoalDecomposer`.
  * **Edges:**
    1.  `START` -> `GoalDecomposer`
    2.  `GoalDecomposer` -> `StrategyFormulator`
    3.  `StrategyFormulator` -> `PromptGenerator`
    4.  `PromptGenerator` -> `PromptEvaluator`
    5.  `PromptEvaluator` -> `ReflectionSynthesizer`
    6.  `ReflectionSynthesizer` -> `NextStepDecider`
  * **Conditional Edges (from `NextStepDecider`):**
      * If the output is `CONTINUE_PROBING`, the next node is `PromptGenerator`.
      * If the output is `REVISE_STRATEGY`, the next node is `StrategyFormulator`.
      * If the output is `FINISH`, the graph execution ends.

This graph structure ensures a logical, robust, and adaptive workflow, perfectly embodying the principles of the P³RO architecture.

## Part 4: Complete Python Implementation with LangGraph and Gemini

The following section outlines the structure and components of the Python script that implements the P³RO agent as specified in the preceding blueprint. The implementation will utilize Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 as the core LLM, LangGraph for orchestrating the agent's control flow, and Pydantic for ensuring structured data exchange. A key constraint is the avoidance of LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to demonstrate a more fundamental and explicit construction of the agent graph.

### 4.1 Project Structure

A modular project structure is recommended for clarity and maintainability:

  * **`main.py`**: The main execution script. It initializes the agent, provides the initial inputs, runs the graph, and prints the results.
  * **`state.py`**: Defines the `AgentState` TypedDict, which serves as the agent's memory.
  * **`tools.py`**: Contains the Python functions for each tool in the P³RO toolkit (`GoalDecomposer`, `StrategyFormulator`, etc.).
  * **`graph.py`**: Constructs and compiles the LangGraph `StatefulGraph`, defining all nodes and edges.
  * **`config.py`**: A file to manage API keys and other configuration settings.

### 4.2 `state.py`: Defining the Agent's Memory

This file will contain the Pydantic models for structured outputs and the `TypedDict` for the agent's overall state, ensuring type safety and clarity throughout the application.

### 4.3 `tools.py`: Implementing the Agent's Capabilities

This file is the functional core of the agent. It will contain a Python function for each tool defined in the blueprint. Each function will be responsible for executing its specific task by formatting a detailed prompt, calling the Gemini API, and parsing the structured JSON response using its corresponding Pydantic model. This explicit implementation of each tool ensures that the agent's actions are transparent and directly traceable to the LLM's reasoning.

### 4.4 `graph.py`: Constructing the Agent's Mind

This script will use LangGraph to assemble the agent's control flow. It will instantiate a `StatefulGraph` with the `AgentState`. Each function from `tools.py` will be added as a node. The script will then define the directed edges between nodes, including the crucial conditional logic branching from the `NextStepDecider` node. This compiled graph represents the complete, executable logic of the P³RO architecture.

### 4.5 `main.py`: Running the Agent

This is the entry point for the application. It will handle setting up the initial state with an example prompt and goal, compiling the graph, and invoking it. To provide maximum transparency into the agent's process, it will stream the output of each node as it executes, allowing the user to observe the P³RO cycle in action: the initial planning, each probe and evaluation, the reflections, and the final decision. This live-tracking of the agent's state makes its complex decision-making process understandable and auditable.
